    "text": "What is a Hypothesis?\n\nA falsifiable statement about the world that forms the basis for scientific enquiry.\nA hypothesis posits the effect we expect to observe in our sample data, in order to make generalisable statements about the effect in the population (Blackwell 2023).\nHypotheses are derived from theories – what we should expect to observe in our data, given the theory.\nQuantitative research seeks to test hypotheses, and the results are a step closer to drawing inferences about the world."
